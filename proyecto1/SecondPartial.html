            <h5 class="Times center">1. How did you apply (or not) iterative design in your project?</h5>
            <p>By sending our page to different people and ask them to give feedback, after the feedback we saw what improvements could be done and what ideas are not viable to do because of our skill level or because it is made with technology that we currently don’t posses, the next step was to search for a solution and apply it to the project, finally we need to send our project again for more feedback.</p>
            <h5 class="Times center">2. Describe the main highlights of your persona. Explain the audience of your project.</h5>
            <p>Our audience is the average car driver in Guadalajara, or Mexico in general. Since the bad quality infrastructure is a common problem around our Nation. In our Persona we based its characteristics in the average driver information the INEGI provided. The average driver is in his 30’s, has at least 4 members in his family, works 8 hours a day and has an middle school degree. Our Persona drives a 2008 Nissan Tsuru one of the most sold cars in the last decade.</p>
            <h5 class="Times center">3. Explain, in your own words, the three principles of system design</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>The first principle is to focus mainly on the user in the beginning, study its nature and use that in the process of design in one way or another.</li>
              <li>The second principle is to always measure the user reactions to any contact with the product, like printed scenarios or when they read the manual.</li>
              <li>The third principle is use trial and error in the design proccess, in other words test the product with users in order to find errors and fix them.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5 class="Times center">4. Create your own methodology to develop a website. It’s important to justify all the steps.</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>First: Ask the client about the purpouse intended for the website, what he is looking to gain from it, so we as developers can have the same goal while building the site.</li>
              <li>Second: To study the context of the website, to have a basic knowledge of the topic in order to have a design that is congruent with the information.</li>
              <li>Third: Creating a basic prototype which will be tested in order to fix the user issues.</li>
              <li>Fourth: Recognize the amount of work needed to be invested on the prototype in order to find an aproximation to the total cost of the develpment.</li>
              <li>Finally: Use iterative design and the client opinion in order to fully develop it.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5 class="Times center">5. Explain the status of your project. Grade your project according to your effort (30%) and result (70%).</h5>
            <p>The status of our project is a 85% complete, becuase we need to make some of the feedback adjustments from the other teams, we also need to add the final details to the propousal and make the interview to the user affected by the problem.</p>
            <h5 class="Times center">6. Explain the status of your interview. Who is your expert? Why? Who is your user?</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Engineer Javier Diaz Ruiz, Civil Engineer, specialized in street construction. Already interviewed. He gave us his point of view of the current status of the city streets, the problems with them, how they affect him, what he thinks should be done, and what he thinks is being done improperly but could be done better.</li>
              <li>User interview is pending but we have one user already waiting to do it.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5 class="Times center">7. Ask another team for their proposal. Compare it with yours. Which one is better? Why?</h5>
            <p>We think is on the same level since they have fully explained their strategy, plan implementation and methodology and we haven’t, but we explain the mission of our team in the introduction, like we were a product we sold our intent of existence in the market while they didn’t. Also we explained the context and abilities of the team, so the clients can create a realistic expectations of our work while the other group just wrote its memebers. Also we have a more complex cost system, since not all projects are all the same we charge propotionally to the amount of effort we give and not only in the amount of time we use to create the page, we focus on quality not quantity.</p>
            <h5 class="Times center">8. Is your project responsive? Explain.</h5>
            <p>Yes, everything is correctly implemented and has been optimized to meet the users needs in order to be more useful and responsive. Everything you can click on has a purpose and works the way intended.</p>
            <h5 class="Times center">9. In your project did you follow the first three laws of simplicity? How?</h5>
            <p>Yes, because we used simple things and different pages for each part to shorten time needed to load all the images, also the images used are not local so they are easier to load. For the organization of the web page we used a simple home page with tabs to the different pages, all the pages share the same tabs so the user can change from one page to another easily. We reduce in our page by replacing the home page cards with a gallery of pictures of the problem and getting the tabs on the top.</p>
            <h5 class="Times center">10. Grade your second term (each member).</h5>
            <p>Fernando Martinez: I would grade myself with a 95 because I have left some work to do the last moment, but I have been putting attention every class and I have done my homework and lectures in time. Every class I do the activity to try new things in JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Marcelo Estrada Medina: I grade myself a 90 as I tried to make myself more useful than last partial, I completed most of the work I needed to, and I think I overall Improved.</p>
            <p>Diego Sanchez Micalco: I will give myself a 90, i have give my attention to the teacher, and read all the study on the design process of the Olympics message system, and wrote code and made a good amount of contribution to the page, proposal and persona.</p>
