      <p class="flow-text a">Guadalajara's streets</p>
      <ol class="flow-text c">
      <p class="flow-text a">Guadalajara is a huge city, with a lot of other small towns around it that are also a part of it. Being the second biggest city in Mexico means that theres going to be a lot of cars driving around, 2 million of them acording to the INEGI. Given the amount of cars circulating this city means there has to be enough infrastructure for them to drive around. Thats why there is aproximately 25 million square meters of streets in Guadalajara. Having a huge amount of streets in a city means theres a lot of surface to care for and a lot of these can break. Unfortunately, Guadalajara has an extreme amount of streets in bad conditions. According to the chief of department of pavement conservation, Alejandro Reinosa Villegas, around 50% of Guadalajara's streets are in bad shape. This is probably due to the lack of quality in the materials used to make Guadalajaras streets. Only 60% of Guadalajara's streets are made with concrete and 33% with asphalt, which tends to get damaged with the rain, and the rest is either dirt or rocky. Also because Guadalajara is such an old city means theres old streets and not every street is perfect. This is a huge problem due to the quantity of streets that are in bad shape and the amount of cars that go through them everyday that have to cope with unpleasand rides and even damaged cars. Also the response time of the goverment is slow and the streets are very neglected sometimes being left broken for months and being fixed most of the time with poor materials that tend to beak too. </p>
