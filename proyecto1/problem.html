      <p>Ugly streets damaged by rain, government negligence and use of low quality materials. Guadalajara has several ugly streets that, when damaged, are fixed in a way that is not leveled and makes it unpleasant to drive on. Specially in rainy season the streets tend to get damaged a lot due to the low quality materials used. In addition, the government tends to wait a lot and take long periods time to fix them and they use, low quality materials, which end up being damaged in the following raining seasons.</p>
