        <li class="b">When: Everyday when you're moving from one place to another you're always haunted by badly made streets, badly patched streets, or flat out broken ones. Specially in Summertime during rain season.</li>
        <li class="b">Where: in the metropolitan zone of Jalisco.</li>
        <li class="b">Why: To cut costs on making and fixing streets and because the government doesn't bother to fix it most of the time.</li>
        <li class="b">How: It affects people that want to go anywhere in the street because it damages cars, makes rides unpleasant, and sometimes it makes it so you can't go to certain places.</li>
